## Library Review

Focus on python libraries (as I'm familiar with them).

* https://github.com/andrewkittredge/financial_fundamentals - clean and simple
* https://github.com/lukerosiak/pysec - somewhat raw and I struggled to get it working
* http://arelle.org/ - powerful - much more than parsing - and looks well
  maintained but I did not use as looked overly complex for my needs
